description = Runs a simple cat job and loads the ARCS-jsdl extension to print out the pbs.pm generated pbs script into the jobdirectoy. The test downloads this script and uses a perl script to compare it with the initial jsdl script to check whether basic job properties are translated correctly from jsdl to rsl to pbs.
